# Examples

In this section, I am going to show additional code examples
to further illustrate `nat20` in use. These include problems like
`Conway's Game of Life`, a simple `Blackjack` simulation, and
a `Run-Length` decoder, along with a practical example inspired by
Advent of Code that calculates the total amount of wrapping paper required
for a set of boxes.
